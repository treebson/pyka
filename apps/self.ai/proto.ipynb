      "tyson: Well I think my criteria of an apology would alleviate any uncertainty\n",
      "tyson: To apologise they would have had to reflect on how they wronged you\n",

      "janice: I don’t think she does\n",
      "tyson: She kind of already explained why she ended up hanging with lev\n",
      "tyson: But it's more that she didn't bother to reach out to you at any point\n",
      "janice: I guess maybe for leaving me hanging and not trying?\n",
      "janice: Yeh\n",
      "tyson: Lev idk\n",

      "janice: The block I think made her angry\n",
      "janice: But I explained to Henry why I did it and said I probs should’ve told her but I just needed time apart etc\n",
      "tyson: I actually didn't say no to lev and Bel coming in because of lev\n",
      "tyson: It's 100% because I hate Bel's guts\n",
      "tyson: There's no evidence against lev other than our intuition\n",
      "tyson: Dude\n",
      "tyson: That was years ago\n",
      "tyson: Does it really count?\n",
      "tyson: Didn't you go see lev and Sam?\n",
      "janice: Hahaha what I guess if there’s things I want to know now to find peace\n",
      "janice: Then I need to preempt what I want to know\n",
      "janice: Because it may never happen again\n",
      "tyson: I mean make peace with lev by all means\n",
      "tyson: If that's what you need to do then do it\n",

      "janice: hello I am writing you some suggestions of places you can visit😊 5 minutes from home you can visit the CATHEDRAL and the ancient gothic quarter with its characteristic streets a 20 minute walk you can visit the PARC DE LA CIUTADELLA where you can find a large fountain and a lake where you can rent a boat and the very characteristic ARCH OF TRIUMPH nearby you can go to visit the PICASSO MUSEUM and the ETHNOLOGICAL MUSEUM Y DE CULTURAS DE MUNDO the area in which they are located is called Born there in the evening it is full of restaurants typical and it is also nice to take a walk in that area you can also visit the PALAU DE LA MUSICA I suggest you visit it only the outside it is very artistic for the works of Gaudi I recommend you visit CASA BATLLO 'and CASA MILA' AND PARC GUELL with the metro you can reach the SAGRADA FAMILIA which I recommend you visit inside as well. From Thursday to Saturday from 21.00 to 22.00 you can visit the MAGIC FOUNTAIN in placa d'espanya during the day you can always visit the NATIONAL MUSEUM from the outside it looks like a castle in placa espanya you will see a circular building this building is the ancient arena of Barcelona now shopping center you can go up to the terrace and admire the very panoramic view as regards the beach the closest is BARCELONETA you can walk it is about 40 minutes but it is a nice walk because it runs along the port I hope it will be useful😊 good day.😉\n",
