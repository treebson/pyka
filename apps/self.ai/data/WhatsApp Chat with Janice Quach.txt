21/1/20, 10:41 pm - Janice Quach: It’s here
21/1/20, 10:41 pm - Janice Quach: It came early
21/1/20, 10:42 pm - tyson: Won't make it
21/1/20, 10:42 pm - tyson: Was looking everywhere for canvas bag
21/1/20, 10:42 pm - Janice Quach: Accidentally put them all in your car forgetting to leave some
21/1/20, 10:42 pm - tyson: Sigh
21/1/20, 10:43 pm - tyson: May as well uber to work
21/1/20, 10:43 pm - tyson: 21 minute wait
21/1/20, 10:44 pm - Janice Quach: Walk to station
21/1/20, 10:44 pm - tyson: I'm ubering
21/1/20, 10:44 pm - Janice Quach: I’ll get there by 9:15 I think
22/1/20, 12:09 pm - Janice Quach: I’m near the bus stop
22/1/20, 12:09 pm - Janice Quach: On the side
22/1/20, 12:09 pm - Janice Quach: Before the light
22/1/20, 10:41 pm - tyson: Woe
22/1/20, 10:41 pm - tyson: Tesla is going nuts
22/1/20, 10:41 pm - tyson: $570 right now
22/1/20, 10:41 pm - tyson: Remember when Elon said he would take it private @ $420/share
22/1/20, 10:42 pm - tyson: That was when the price was about $300
22/1/20, 10:42 pm - Janice Quach: Omg 126%
22/1/20, 10:42 pm - tyson: It's fucking close to double now
22/1/20, 10:42 pm - tyson: Tesla has paid off so well
22/1/20, 10:42 pm - tyson: Jesus christ
22/1/20, 10:42 pm - tyson: If you wanted to cash out it wouldn't be a bad time
22/1/20, 10:42 pm - tyson: Or rebalance
22/1/20, 10:43 pm - tyson: Rebalance = sell some Tesla and reinvest in other stocks or assets
22/1/20, 10:43 pm - tyson: Long term investors typically rebalance every 6 months I think
22/1/20, 10:43 pm - Janice Quach: Ohhh
22/1/20, 10:43 pm - Janice Quach: Can we try do that tnight o:
22/1/20, 10:43 pm - Janice Quach: I’m scared too
22/1/20, 10:43 pm - Janice Quach: 😅😅
22/1/20, 10:43 pm - tyson: LOL
22/1/20, 10:44 pm - tyson: Do you want to sell and withdraw to put into your apartment
22/1/20, 10:44 pm - Janice Quach: Ohhh
22/1/20, 10:44 pm - tyson: Or do you want to sell and buy another company's shares?
22/1/20, 10:44 pm - tyson: If you do the former you need to pay tax on whatever gain you made
22/1/20, 10:44 pm - Janice Quach: Maybe another company
22/1/20, 10:45 pm - tyson: Okay well
22/1/20, 10:45 pm - tyson: See what company you want and see much how Tesla you want to sell
22/1/20, 10:45 pm - tyson: I'm personally going to hold tesla
22/1/20, 10:45 pm - tyson: I believe in the company
22/1/20, 10:45 pm - Janice Quach: Shared are confusing
22/1/20, 10:45 pm - tyson: Although there's a good chance it's overvalued atm
22/1/20, 10:45 pm - Janice Quach: Couldn’t it crash at any point
22/1/20, 10:45 pm - tyson: It can
22/1/20, 10:45 pm - tyson: But so can property
22/1/20, 10:45 pm - Janice Quach: Right
22/1/20, 10:46 pm - tyson: The 2004 global financial crises was caused by a the bust of a property bubble
22/1/20, 10:46 pm - tyson: Any market is subject to bubbles
22/1/20, 10:46 pm - tyson: When you have a market deciding the price of an asset by buying and selling, it is inevitably propped up by investor belief in the value of that asset
22/1/20, 10:47 pm - Janice Quach: Hmm I think I’m uncertain about last night because marcelas immediate thoughts about three years ago was ‘I don’t know what happened it was so long but also so many things and not just the single time’
22/1/20, 10:47 pm - tyson: A bubble bursting is people suddenly realising something is overvalued and everyone selling at once
22/1/20, 10:47 pm - tyson: The increase in supply and decrease in demand results in the value dropping
22/1/20, 10:47 pm - Janice Quach: I think it makes me uneasy at how she didn’t have a clear understanding of her decisions at that time. But maybe that was the problem? That everyone didn’t know what to do and why they did it
22/1/20, 10:48 pm - Janice Quach: Makes sense
22/1/20, 10:48 pm - tyson: Now that you mention it that did stick out in my mind
22/1/20, 10:48 pm - tyson: It shows that she hasn't truly reflected on what happened
22/1/20, 10:48 pm - tyson: And therefore is unlikely to apologise
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - Janice Quach: Yeh..
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - tyson: It's naivety
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - Janice Quach: I don’t think marcela was directly involved either
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - tyson: And lack of self awareness
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - tyson: She wasnt
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - Janice Quach: At least for the single event
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - tyson: But she chose a side
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - tyson: As if you don't question the actions of your friends when they do something like that
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - Janice Quach: Yeh :/ and didn’t bother understanding mine
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - tyson: Fair analysis
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - Janice Quach: I did
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - tyson: Not you
22/1/20, 10:49 pm - tyson: @marcela
22/1/20, 10:50 pm - Janice Quach: Ahh right
22/1/20, 10:50 pm - Janice Quach: The only person I can really understand everything is lev
22/1/20, 10:50 pm - Janice Quach: Tbh
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - Janice Quach: But yeh defs not ready for it
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - tyson: Well I think my criteria of an apology would alleviate any uncertainty
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - tyson: To apologise they would have had to reflect on how they wronged you
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - tyson: And repent
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - Janice Quach: Yeh true
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - Janice Quach: I’m ready to apologise for what I did
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - tyson: Yeah
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - tyson: But you're not going to apologise first
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - Janice Quach: But I’m not so sure for them,
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - tyson: I won't let you do that
22/1/20, 10:51 pm - Janice Quach: In previous fights they wouldn’t apologise
22/1/20, 10:52 pm - Janice Quach: Yeh i won’t
22/1/20, 10:52 pm - Janice Quach: I preferred making up
22/1/20, 10:53 pm - tyson: Well
22/1/20, 10:53 pm - Janice Quach: I think you pinpointed it in terms of reflection 😅
22/1/20, 10:53 pm - tyson: Maybe Marcela doesn't need to apologise
22/1/20, 10:53 pm - Janice Quach: I don’t think she does
22/1/20, 10:53 pm - tyson: She kind of already explained why she ended up hanging with lev
22/1/20, 10:53 pm - tyson: But it's more that she didn't bother to reach out to you at any point
22/1/20, 10:53 pm - Janice Quach: I guess maybe for leaving me hanging and not trying?
22/1/20, 10:53 pm - Janice Quach: Yeh
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - tyson: Lev idk
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - Janice Quach: Kept saying things like ‘growing apart’
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - Janice Quach: Levs tried a couple times
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - tyson: We have this huge tinfoil hat theory that she's the puppeteer behind all the drama
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - Janice Quach: I can recount 4?
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - Janice Quach: 3 or 4 times
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - tyson: Tried what?
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - Janice Quach: Reaching out
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - Janice Quach: Making amends
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - tyson: Really
22/1/20, 10:54 pm - Janice Quach: Yes
22/1/20, 10:55 pm - tyson: Even after the block?
22/1/20, 10:55 pm - tyson: I wasn't aware of this
22/1/20, 10:55 pm - Janice Quach: After the fight , we went raving, the party
22/1/20, 10:55 pm - Janice Quach: The block I think made her angry
22/1/20, 10:55 pm - Janice Quach: But I explained to Henry why I did it and said I probs should’ve told her but I just needed time apart etc
22/1/20, 10:56 pm - tyson: I actually didn't say no to lev and Bel coming in because of lev
22/1/20, 10:56 pm - tyson: It's 100% because I hate Bel's guts
22/1/20, 10:56 pm - tyson: There's no evidence against lev other than our intuition
22/1/20, 10:56 pm - tyson: Dude
22/1/20, 10:57 pm - tyson: That was years ago
22/1/20, 10:57 pm - tyson: Does it really count?
22/1/20, 10:57 pm - tyson: Didn't you go see lev and Sam?
22/1/20, 10:57 pm - Janice Quach: Hahaha what I guess if there’s things I want to know now to find peace
22/1/20, 10:57 pm - Janice Quach: Then I need to preempt what I want to know
22/1/20, 10:57 pm - Janice Quach: Because it may never happen again
22/1/20, 10:57 pm - tyson: I mean make peace with lev by all means
22/1/20, 10:57 pm - tyson: If that's what you need to do then do it
22/1/20, 10:57 pm - Janice Quach: Yeh and Henry
22/1/20, 10:58 pm - Janice Quach: I know 😂😂
22/1/20, 10:58 pm - Janice Quach: Anyway thanks for letting me sound board it
22/1/20, 10:59 pm - tyson: I think our opinion of lev may be subject to confirmation bias
22/1/20, 11:00 pm - Janice Quach: Haha I guess I do have ptsd from bel calling me toxic 😂
22/1/20, 11:00 pm - tyson: There is a risk that it is
22/1/20, 11:00 pm - Janice Quach: Yeh ><
22/1/20, 11:00 pm - Janice Quach: Iddkkk
22/1/20, 11:00 pm - tyson: Bel can go shove it up her ass
22/1/20, 11:00 pm - Janice Quach: Anyways there’s no answer
22/1/20, 11:00 pm - tyson: Stupid bitch

4/2/20, 2:43 am - Janice Quach: https://www.instagram.com/p/B8HrDS-JLCN/?igshid=q45siqml9vx6
4/2/20, 2:43 am - Janice Quach: So relevant
4/2/20, 2:43 am - Janice Quach: The quote
4/2/20, 2:44 am - tyson: I've also heard Vicky and Jeff we explicitly say: you can only lead by example
4/2/20, 2:44 am - tyson: Or lead by example, it's all you can do
4/2/20, 2:44 am - tyson: And tbh thats kind of already happening
4/2/20, 2:44 am - tyson: People get imposter syndrome around us?
4/2/20, 2:45 am - tyson: I'm pretty sure that's because we have been living by that quote for years now
4/2/20, 2:45 am - tyson: And the gap is widening

4/2/20, 2:46 am - tyson: Well yeah it sounds like a reframed version of my mentality
4/2/20, 2:46 am - tyson: The best revenge is a life well lived
4/2/20, 2:46 am - tyson: You make them regret mistreating you
4/2/20, 2:46 am - tyson: By living your life well
4/2/20, 2:46 am - tyson: And having them realise that you didn't need them from the start
4/2/20, 2:46 am - tyson: That your life is awesome without them
4/2/20, 2:58 am - Janice Quach: true true

5/2/20, 7:01 am - tyson: She was good
5/2/20, 7:01 am - Janice Quach: Thanks babe
5/2/20, 8:04 am - tyson: I don't know why
5/2/20, 8:04 am - tyson: But eddie keeps triggeringnme
5/2/20, 8:04 am - tyson: He landed a job recently
5/2/20, 8:04 am - tyson: And decided to give me unsolicited interview advice just then
5/2/20, 8:04 am - Janice Quach: Oh yeh he mentioned he interviewed somewhere
5/2/20, 8:04 am - tyson: "are you serious about applying for a new job?"
5/2/20, 8:04 am - Janice Quach: Oh lol how so
5/2/20, 8:04 am - tyson: Um yes wtf
5/2/20, 8:04 am - Janice Quach: Did you ask why he asked that?
5/2/20, 8:05 am - tyson: <Media omitted>
5/2/20, 8:05 am - tyson: And then goes on to say failure is enlightening
5/2/20, 8:05 am - tyson: Like what the fuck is going on
5/2/20, 8:05 am - tyson: Why am I getting unsolicited advice from fucking eddie?
5/2/20, 8:06 am - Janice Quach: Ohh
5/2/20, 8:06 am - tyson: Like dude
5/2/20, 8:06 am - Janice Quach: I’m not sure
5/2/20, 8:06 am - tyson: I didn't ask you for your opinion
5/2/20, 8:06 am - tyson: Nor did I ask for your advice
5/2/20, 8:06 am - Janice Quach: I think he’s just trying to g you into putting your all in it
5/2/20, 8:06 am - tyson: Stop giving me advice in an area where I'm clearly better than you
5/2/20, 8:06 am - tyson: Fuck
5/2/20, 8:06 am - Janice Quach: Hunny egos talking
5/2/20, 8:06 am - tyson: Yeah it is
5/2/20, 8:06 am - Janice Quach: He only has the best intent for you
5/2/20, 8:07 am - tyson: I don't know why
5/2/20, 8:07 am - tyson: But this topic is a high trigger area for me
5/2/20, 8:07 am - Janice Quach: Yeh :/
5/2/20, 8:08 am - tyson: I hate getting unsolicited advice in an area where I know I'm better than others at
5/2/20, 8:08 am - Janice Quach: Why do you recon the advice triggers you
5/2/20, 8:08 am - tyson: It would be like max giving me tennis advice or something
5/2/20, 8:08 am - tyson: It's like fuck off
5/2/20, 8:08 am - tyson: This conversation doesnt add value
5/2/20, 8:08 am - tyson: And is a waste of my fucking time
5/2/20, 8:09 am - tyson: The way I see it with Eddie is that he's landed 2 jobs in the last 6 months
5/2/20, 8:09 am - tyson: He's feeling more confident
5/2/20, 8:09 am - tyson: And suddenly thinks it's okay to reverse our roll re: job interview advice
5/2/20, 8:09 am - tyson: I didn't fucking ask you bro
5/2/20, 8:10 am - tyson: These feelings I'm having aren't normal
5/2/20, 8:10 am - tyson: It's a manifestation of my superiority complex
5/2/20, 8:10 am - Janice Quach: Wel did you mention your applying tho?
5/2/20, 8:10 am - tyson: I did
5/2/20, 8:11 am - Janice Quach: Technically that opens up the space for advice then
5/2/20, 8:11 am - tyson: Maybe
5/2/20, 8:11 am - tyson: I'll just keep it to myself next time
5/2/20, 8:11 am - tyson: Well he has 0 clue that I'm triggered
5/2/20, 8:11 am - Janice Quach: Yeh say things with intent and understand once it comes out it invites comments
5/2/20, 8:12 am - tyson: Well the intention was there
5/2/20, 8:13 am - tyson: Telling people about a goal introduces social accountability
5/2/20, 8:14 am - tyson: Idk why I see Eddie this way
5/2/20, 8:14 am - tyson: I think him telling me he joined boardgeeks fucked me
5/2/20, 8:14 am - tyson: I don't wish good on him anymore
5/2/20, 8:14 am - Janice Quach: Oh no :(
5/2/20, 8:14 am - tyson: Part of me wishes he will fail
5/2/20, 8:15 am - tyson: But I override that with the rational part of my brain
5/2/20, 8:15 am - tyson: It's the same competitive side of me that wishes bad upon people who have crossed me
5/2/20, 8:15 am - tyson: But now Eddie has been rolled into that bunch of people
5/2/20, 8:15 am - tyson: Fucking hell
5/2/20, 8:16 am - Janice Quach: Gah oh no
5/2/20, 8:16 am - Janice Quach: I think you need space from him
5/2/20, 8:16 am - tyson: I think that's what's happening here
5/2/20, 8:16 am - tyson: I'm honestly just despising him
5/2/20, 8:16 am - tyson: But we have good conversations
5/2/20, 8:16 am - tyson: It's just he's gaining ground on me
5/2/20, 8:16 am - tyson: And I don't like it
5/2/20, 8:16 am - Janice Quach: Yeh
5/2/20, 8:17 am - Janice Quach: Grow apart
5/2/20, 8:17 am - tyson: Because he turned me down
5/2/20, 8:17 am - Janice Quach: Come back again
5/2/20, 8:17 am - tyson: So now I'm viewing him as a competitor
5/2/20, 8:17 am - tyson: Fuck sake
5/2/20, 8:17 am - Janice Quach: HAHA
5/2/20, 8:17 am - Janice Quach: yeh and to Alan too
5/2/20, 8:17 am - Janice Quach: But eddies mates with him
5/2/20, 8:17 am - tyson: Never would have seen this coming
5/2/20, 8:17 am - tyson: Fuck Alan
5/2/20, 8:17 am - tyson: He won't go anywhere
5/2/20, 8:17 am - Janice Quach: I’m heading to SH now
5/2/20, 8:17 am - tyson: Eddie has 10x more potential than him
5/2/20, 8:17 am - Janice Quach: Hiring another person under me
5/2/20, 8:17 am - tyson: Alan's a fucking small fish compared to eddie
5/2/20, 8:17 am - Janice Quach: This is intense
5/2/20, 8:17 am - Janice Quach: Hahah
5/2/20, 8:17 am - tyson: Eddie is the highest potential individual I know
5/2/20, 8:17 am - tyson: Probably more than Jacky
5/2/20, 8:18 am - Janice Quach: And turns out the guy Bev found is someone from uni 🤣 he’s so chill so should be good
5/2/20, 8:18 am - Janice Quach: Yeh he’s definitely excelling at the moment
5/2/20, 8:18 am - tyson: Jacky's strength is not his focus, it's his purpose driven decision making
5/2/20, 8:18 am - tyson: Eddie is raw unrelenting focus and willpower
5/2/20, 8:18 am - Janice Quach: Yeh
5/2/20, 8:19 am - tyson: Probably more than me
5/2/20, 8:19 am - tyson: But I got a head start
5/2/20, 8:19 am - tyson: But here I am fucking bootstrapping his fire
5/2/20, 8:19 am - Janice Quach: Yep
5/2/20, 8:19 am - tyson: Only for him to backstab me
5/2/20, 8:19 am - tyson: I'm going to crush him
5/2/20, 8:19 am - Janice Quach: I think you’re taking it way too personally
5/2/20, 8:19 am - Janice Quach: :/
5/2/20, 8:19 am - Janice Quach: In a way eddies also utilising board game geeks
5/2/20, 8:20 am - Janice Quach: It’s all for selfish reasons
5/2/20, 8:20 am - tyson: I don't care about boardgeeks
5/2/20, 8:20 am - tyson: I care about Eddie surpassing me
5/2/20, 8:20 am - tyson: And I'll do everything in my power to stop him
5/2/20, 8:21 am - tyson: Boardgeeks was simply the spark that made Eddie a competitor
5/2/20, 8:21 am - tyson: Unless Eddie and I launch a project he will always be a competitor
5/2/20, 8:21 am - tyson: That is unless I land tesla or DeepMind
5/2/20, 8:21 am - tyson: Then gg
5/2/20, 8:21 am - tyson: Game set fucking match
5/2/20, 8:21 am - tyson: Or successfully launch a tech company
5/2/20, 8:21 am - Janice Quach: HHhahaha
5/2/20, 8:21 am - tyson: There will be no more competition
5/2/20, 8:21 am - Janice Quach: Envy
5/2/20, 8:21 am - Janice Quach: I understand
5/2/20, 8:21 am - Janice Quach: Your feelings
5/2/20, 8:22 am - tyson: Is there envy?
5/2/20, 8:22 am - tyson: Eddie has nothing I want
5/2/20, 8:22 am - Janice Quach: I think so
5/2/20, 8:22 am - tyson: I strive to have people envy me
5/2/20, 8:22 am - tyson: Because it satiates pride
5/2/20, 8:23 am - Janice Quach: malicious envy being proposed as a sick force that ruins a person and his/her mind and causes the envious person to blindly want the "hero" to suffer; on the other hand, benign envy being proposed as a type of positive motivational force that causes the person to aspire to be as good as the "hero"—but only if benign envy is used in a right way.[
5/2/20, 8:29 am - tyson: Eddie isn't a hero though
5/2/20, 8:29 am - tyson: I don't want him to suffer
5/2/20, 8:29 am - Janice Quach: It’s a ‘hero’
5/2/20, 8:29 am - tyson: I want him to envy me
5/2/20, 8:29 am - Janice Quach: You did say that 😅
5/2/20, 8:29 am - Janice Quach: You want him to fail
5/2/20, 8:29 am - Janice Quach: I think pride takes over you
5/2/20, 8:29 am - Janice Quach: Rather than feeling depressive
5/2/20, 8:29 am - Janice Quach: You go the other way
5/2/20, 8:29 am - tyson: Well
5/2/20, 8:29 am - Janice Quach: 😅
5/2/20, 8:29 am - tyson: Ive always operated like this
5/2/20, 8:29 am - tyson: And it gets the job done
5/2/20, 8:29 am - tyson: I just uninstalled clash royale
5/2/20, 8:30 am - tyson: I'm launching a crush Eddie campaign
5/2/20, 8:30 am - Janice Quach: Wow well done babe
5/2/20, 8:30 am - tyson: I actually want him to accelerate
5/2/20, 8:30 am - tyson: Because I know I'll always stay ahead of him
5/2/20, 8:30 am - tyson: The harder he pushes the harder I will
5/2/20, 8:30 am - tyson: I want him to take all of Alan's advice
5/2/20, 8:31 am - tyson: So I can fucking make him regret that
5/2/20, 8:31 am - Janice Quach: Benign envy
5/2/20, 8:31 am - Janice Quach: Is neutral
5/2/20, 8:31 am - tyson: But I don't envy people
5/2/20, 8:31 am - tyson: It's more anger @ betrayal
5/2/20, 8:31 am - tyson: The only person I might envy are entrepreneurs that have found more success than me
5/2/20, 8:33 am - tyson: I envy Alexandr Wang from silicon valley
5/2/20, 8:33 am - tyson: 21 year old entrepreneur who founded scale.ai
5/2/20, 8:33 am - tyson: Received 120 million in funding
5/2/20, 8:33 am - tyson: I envy him
5/2/20, 8:33 am - tyson: I envy people who are younger than me and have found more success
5/2/20, 8:33 am - tyson: Eddie does not fall in that camp
5/2/20, 8:33 am - tyson: I'm angry that Eddie betrayed me
5/2/20, 8:34 am - tyson: And is taking advice from Alan
5/2/20, 8:34 am - tyson: Who I don't respect that much from a career perspective
5/2/20, 8:34 am - tyson: And that anger and pride is fueling my passion to crush him so that he regrets turning down my offer
5/2/20, 8:34 am - tyson: Is how I would describe the situation
5/2/20, 8:35 am - Janice Quach: Sophie landed a job at westpac ! Pre cool
5/2/20, 8:35 am - tyson: And him giving me unsolicited career advice just now is like spitting in my face
5/2/20, 8:35 am - Janice Quach: :/
5/2/20, 8:35 am - tyson: And he has 0 idea it's triggering me to this degree
5/2/20, 8:35 am - Janice Quach: Oh gosh hunny
5/2/20, 8:35 am - tyson: Good on her
5/2/20, 8:35 am - Janice Quach: Take a breath babe
5/2/20, 8:35 am - Janice Quach: Just let it be
5/2/20, 8:36 am - tyson: I'm fine lol
5/2/20, 8:36 am - tyson: I'm not actually angry
5/2/20, 8:36 am - tyson: I'm just mildly annoyed
5/2/20, 8:36 am - tyson: And thinking fuck this guy in my head
5/2/20, 8:36 am - Janice Quach: :/
5/2/20, 8:37 am - tyson: Can you relate to any of these feelings?
5/2/20, 8:37 am - Janice Quach: Mmm I don’t think it’s healthy , if you don’t want advice don’t talk about it
5/2/20, 8:37 am - Janice Quach: Everyone loves to voice their opinions
5/2/20, 8:38 am - tyson: Idk I feel like I always have phases where I get these feelings
5/2/20, 8:38 am - tyson: And it has always added fuel to my motivation
5/2/20, 8:38 am - tyson: I won't talk about it
5/2/20, 8:38 am - tyson: With Eddie anymore
5/2/20, 8:38 am - tyson: Lol
5/2/20, 8:39 am - tyson: The only difference now is that I've never been able to take a step back and label the thoughts im having
5/2/20, 8:39 am - tyson: I'm normally just thinking them
5/2/20, 8:39 am - tyson: I can recognise its not healthy
5/2/20, 8:39 am - tyson: But i cant stop myself from feeling them
5/2/20, 8:40 am - tyson: So if that's the case I may as well wield them for good
5/2/20, 8:40 am - tyson: Like deleting clash royale is an objectively good decision
5/2/20, 8:40 am - Janice Quach: Yep :)
5/2/20, 8:40 am - Janice Quach: Definitely
5/2/20, 8:40 am - tyson: But it took me having to get triggered by Eddie to do it
5/2/20, 8:40 am - Janice Quach: Frequently I feel
5/2/20, 8:40 am - tyson: Competitiveness is a bitch
5/2/20, 8:40 am - Janice Quach: Yeh extrinsic
5/2/20, 8:40 am - Janice Quach: Or external influence
5/2/20, 8:41 am - Janice Quach: I get it quite abit with Bev for some reason
5/2/20, 8:41 am - Janice Quach: But her successs is my success
5/2/20, 8:41 am - Janice Quach: So it makes no sense
5/2/20, 8:41 am - Janice Quach: I’m just worried I’ll fuck it
5/2/20, 8:41 am - tyson: That's strange as fuck
5/2/20, 8:41 am - Janice Quach: Up
5/2/20, 8:41 am - tyson: Because she's your report
5/2/20, 8:41 am - tyson: By definition she's below you
5/2/20, 8:41 am - tyson: And you're working toward the same goal
5/2/20, 8:41 am - Janice Quach: Yeh
5/2/20, 8:41 am - Janice Quach: exactly it’s not logical
5/2/20, 8:41 am - tyson: I think my feelings towards Eddie would evaporate if we kicked off a project
5/2/20, 8:42 am - Janice Quach: I’m sure I’ve had these feelings towards Sam
5/2/20, 8:42 am - Janice Quach: Or any inta people
5/2/20, 8:42 am - Janice Quach: There’s been cases I turned it for good
5/2/20, 8:42 am - Janice Quach: But times where I let it pass
5/2/20, 8:43 am - tyson: I think most of the time I channel that into motivation for my own actions
5/2/20, 8:43 am - tyson: But I know deep down
5/2/20, 8:43 am - tyson: I would be satisfied if they failed
5/2/20, 8:43 am - tyson: But that's something I keep to myself
5/2/20, 8:43 am - Janice Quach: Yeh
5/2/20, 8:43 am - Janice Quach: For sure
5/2/20, 8:43 am - tyson: And suppress the fuck out of
5/2/20, 8:43 am - Janice Quach: Feel ya
5/2/20, 8:43 am - tyson: But obviously with you it's a safe space to label that thought
5/2/20, 8:43 am - Janice Quach: I donno if it’ll ever go away
5/2/20, 8:43 am - Janice Quach: It’s a natural response
5/2/20, 8:44 am - tyson: I don't think it will
5/2/20, 8:44 am - tyson: In a competitive setting
5/2/20, 8:44 am - tyson: There's 2 things you can do to win
5/2/20, 8:44 am - tyson: Elevate yourself
5/2/20, 8:44 am - tyson: Or hope the opponent self destructs
5/2/20, 8:44 am - tyson: In tennis that was always the case
5/2/20, 8:44 am - tyson: But the thing is
5/2/20, 8:44 am - Janice Quach: Well I’d say reflect on why I’m feeling this way, why am I not satisfied with what I have? Then action
5/2/20, 8:44 am - tyson: You can't control what your opponent does
5/2/20, 8:44 am - tyson: So there's only 1 thing worth focusing on
5/2/20, 8:44 am - tyson: That's the rational override
5/2/20, 8:45 am - tyson: I know why I'm upset with Eddie
5/2/20, 8:45 am - tyson: I just don't know if I should share with him
5/2/20, 8:45 am - tyson: Or just straight up crush him
5/2/20, 8:45 am - Janice Quach: Yeh
5/2/20, 8:45 am - tyson: I'm opting for #2
5/2/20, 8:45 am - Janice Quach: Your dabbling in a friend for use or friend for support
5/2/20, 8:45 am - Janice Quach: And I don’t think you know which it is
5/2/20, 8:45 am - tyson: He's not a friend of goodness for sure
5/2/20, 8:46 am - tyson: Which sucks
5/2/20, 8:46 am - tyson: But that's the way it is
5/2/20, 8:46 am - tyson: I've only known him for 3 years
5/2/20, 8:46 am - Janice Quach: Sure but your emotions seem otherwise
5/2/20, 8:46 am - Janice Quach: Like what do you want from him?
5/2/20, 8:46 am - Janice Quach: What’s the point then?
5/2/20, 8:46 am - tyson: Don't know anymore
5/2/20, 8:46 am - Janice Quach: Are you even utilising him well?
5/2/20, 8:46 am - tyson: Feels like I'm just doing charity work by helping him
5/2/20, 8:46 am - Janice Quach: You don’t even respect him in some ways but do in others
5/2/20, 8:46 am - tyson: I guess I want to use him as an opponent?
5/2/20, 8:46 am - Janice Quach: 😅😅
5/2/20, 8:46 am - tyson: Because I thrive in competition
5/2/20, 8:47 am - tyson: Idk why
5/2/20, 8:47 am - Janice Quach: I see
5/2/20, 8:47 am - tyson: I respect some parts of him
5/2/20, 8:47 am - Janice Quach: Yeh I remember it’s like
5/2/20, 8:47 am - Janice Quach: When Jess said
5/2/20, 8:47 am - Janice Quach: Why do I need to do psychology
5/2/20, 8:47 am - Janice Quach: And I’m like wtf
5/2/20, 8:47 am - tyson: Yeah
5/2/20, 8:47 am - tyson: It's like that
5/2/20, 8:47 am - tyson: ...
5/2/20, 8:47 am - Janice Quach: And I helped her with chatting to nikki
5/2/20, 8:47 am - Janice Quach: Told her about what i do many times
5/2/20, 8:47 am - Janice Quach: But tbh I knew it’s because she felt threatened
5/2/20, 8:48 am - Janice Quach: By me doing what was essentially ‘her dibs’
5/2/20, 8:48 am - tyson: Yeah
5/2/20, 8:48 am - Janice Quach: I mean I assume it is
5/2/20, 8:48 am - tyson: I'm feeling threatened by Eddie right now
5/2/20, 8:48 am - Janice Quach: Because I’d feel the same
5/2/20, 8:48 am - tyson: So I need to fucking crush him
5/2/20, 8:48 am - Janice Quach: Yeh he’s stepping in your field
5/2/20, 8:48 am - Janice Quach: Your turf
5/2/20, 8:48 am - Janice Quach: 😅
5/2/20, 8:48 am - tyson: And I've been helping him
5/2/20, 8:49 am - Janice Quach: It’s definitely a hit to the ego
5/2/20, 8:49 am - Janice Quach: With what made you unique
5/2/20, 8:49 am - tyson: Well
5/2/20, 8:49 am - tyson: It's not yet
5/2/20, 8:49 am - Janice Quach: Yeh but that’s cod your supportive
5/2/20, 8:49 am - Janice Quach: And it’s so good that you are
5/2/20, 8:49 am - tyson: It will be soon
5/2/20, 8:49 am - Janice Quach: That’s what a good person does
5/2/20, 8:49 am - tyson: Thanks babe
5/2/20, 8:50 am - tyson: I'm amazed you think I'm a good person after all Ive told you
5/2/20, 8:50 am - tyson: I have these toxic thoughts in my head
5/2/20, 8:50 am - tyson: And they consume me
5/2/20, 8:50 am - Janice Quach: :(
5/2/20, 8:50 am - tyson: But fuel my passion so not sure if it's good or bad
5/2/20, 8:50 am - tyson: In any case
5/2/20, 8:50 am - tyson: I welcome this competition
5/2/20, 8:50 am - Janice Quach: Doesn’t have to be good or bad
5/2/20, 8:50 am - tyson: Bring it on

20/2/20, 1:01 am - Janice Quach: whatcha want to do tonight
20/2/20, 1:01 am - Janice Quach: oh did you see him face to face?
20/2/20, 1:01 am - tyson: He actually commented that we've never talked about this stuff before and he enjoys it
20/2/20, 1:01 am - tyson: So thats good
20/2/20, 1:01 am - Janice Quach: oh good!
20/2/20, 1:01 am - tyson: Also getting Jacky and frannys sides of how they view one another
20/2/20, 1:01 am - tyson: Both have said it's hard to get to know each other on a deeper level
20/2/20, 1:02 am - tyson: Kinda coming to the realisation that I'm the glue that holds the 3 of us together
20/2/20, 1:02 am - Janice Quach: haha yeh
20/2/20, 1:02 am - Janice Quach: mediator
20/2/20, 1:02 am - Janice Quach: I think its about egos
20/2/20, 1:02 am - tyson: Jacky = purpose
Franny = hard work
Tyson = intelligence
20/2/20, 1:02 am - Janice Quach: thats my observatiton
20/2/20, 1:02 am - tyson: They're both pretty egotistical
20/2/20, 1:02 am - Janice Quach: yeh
20/2/20, 1:02 am - tyson: But it's interesting that the respect I have for both of them isn't shared between them
20/2/20, 1:03 am - tyson: Franny doesn't respect jackys purpose driven decision making as much as me
20/2/20, 1:03 am - tyson: And Jacky doesn't respect frannys hard working nature as much as me
20/2/20, 1:03 am - tyson: But when I met them both I had neither
20/2/20, 1:03 am - tyson: So Ive kinda just been bouncing on a spectrum between them
20/2/20, 1:03 am - Janice Quach: does it matter whether its 'more than another'?
20/2/20, 1:03 am - tyson: They both think they are hardworking and have purpose
20/2/20, 1:03 am - Janice Quach: people respect different qualities
20/2/20, 1:04 am - tyson: Yeah
20/2/20, 1:04 am - tyson: I think there's a lack of reowxt of that quality between them
20/2/20, 1:04 am - tyson: Respect
20/2/20, 1:04 am - tyson: But I asked Francis, when was the last time just you and Jacky did a 1 on 1
20/2/20, 1:04 am - tyson: And the answer is basically never lol
20/2/20, 1:04 am - Janice Quach: yeh they havent gone deep
20/2/20, 1:04 am - tyson: How many 1:1s have I done with both of them
20/2/20, 1:05 am - Janice Quach: its still surface
20/2/20, 1:05 am - tyson: They are only scratching the surface of one another
20/2/20, 1:05 am - tyson: Exactly
20/2/20, 1:06 am - tyson: Anyway that convo deepens my understanding of both Jacky and Francis
20/2/20, 1:06 am - tyson: So it's a good thing
20/2/20, 1:06 am - tyson: I'm having a really good day lol
20/2/20, 1:06 am - tyson: Hope you are too :)

A Life on Our Planet has inspired me to dedicate the next underwater painting series to it. I hope to raise some awareness around the current situation our oceans are facing. Unfortunately there is an increase in temperature which has affected marine populations. We can all try and do our small part everyday to reduce our impact. How will you today?

27/5/22, 8:36 am - tyson: Hi all,

 

Today marks my last day at Quantium. This time next week, I will be moving to Europe with my partner Janice in pursuit of adventure.


My last 4 years at Quantium have been filled with incredible learning opportunities and fascinating projects. I think it goes without saying though, that the factor that makes Quantium really stand out is the people.

 

If you are receiving this email then it means that you played a role, either large or small, in enriching my time at Quantium. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

 

I would like to call out my appreciation to the following individuals (sort ascending):

* Andrey Ponomarev – For your mentorship during Deep Refinery. Your understanding of machine learning is second to none. Thank you for imparting your wisdom.

* Brendon Lai – For setting the standard of what quality work looks like. Keep up the ridiculous level of productivity and thank you for the support over the last 2 years.

* Frederick Kruger – For believing in the vision of deep learning at Quantium. You were the catalyst for my career shift from software engineering to data science.

* Giuliano Caliari – For being both a fantastic manager and a close friend. Thank you for the many conversations we’ve had about engineering, philosophy, and life. I look forward to many more chats in the future.

* Ishan Bapat – For your adaptive management style and analytical pragmatism. The milestones we worked on were smooth sailing under your leadership. Thank you for being an awesome manager and team leader.

* Jason Kong – For the 1:1 mentorship while I was an engineering grad in Media. It’s hard to believe that you were the one who taught me Git. Thank you for teaching me the principles of good code.

* Orion Leung – For your mentorship, clear explanations and taking the leap of faith with Deep Refinery. The amount I have learned from you is immeasurable. Thank you for your teachings over the years.

 

I'm not good at saying goodbye, so instead I'm going to say - until next time.

22/9/22, 5:47 pm - Janice Quach: hello I am writing you some suggestions of places you can visit😊, 5 minutes from home you can visit the CATHEDRAL and the ancient gothic quarter with its characteristic streets, a 20 minute walk you can visit the PARC DE LA CIUTADELLA where you can find a large fountain and a lake where you can rent a boat and the very characteristic ARCH OF TRIUMPH, nearby you can go to visit the PICASSO MUSEUM and the ETHNOLOGICAL MUSEUM Y DE CULTURAS DE MUNDO, the area in which they are located is called Born, there in the evening it is full of restaurants typical and it is also nice to take a walk, in that area you can also visit the PALAU DE LA MUSICA, I suggest you visit it only the outside, it is very artistic, for the works of Gaudi I recommend you visit CASA BATLLO 'and CASA MILA' AND PARC GUELL, with the metro you can reach the SAGRADA FAMILIA which I recommend you visit inside as well. From Thursday to Saturday from 21.00 to 22.00 you can visit the MAGIC FOUNTAIN in placa d'espanya, during the day you can always visit the NATIONAL MUSEUM from the outside it looks like a castle, in placa espanya you will see a circular building, this building is the ancient arena of Barcelona now shopping center, you can go up to the terrace and admire the very panoramic view, as regards the beach, the closest is BARCELONETA, you can walk it is about 40 minutes but it is a nice walk because it runs along the port, I hope it will be useful😊 good day.😉
